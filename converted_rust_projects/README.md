As discussed in the Tractor Team meeting on Jan 7th 2027, the contents of this folder are not pushed to Git.

The contents can be generated by executing the `run_on_<dataset>()` functions in `scripts/run_c2rust_and_get_datasets.py`. Each such function execution produces a subfolder `./c2rust_<dataset>` containing (unsafe) Rust projects obtained via running C2Rust in bulk on an existing `<dataset>` of C projects. The subfolder will also contain a `results.csv` file with success / failure status of C2Rust-ification each project.

If you don't want to run the script and instead just get the subfolders containing Rust projects, they are each zipped up and uploaded to Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1jIB0TyJOsmL9nl0rALTEj9qugdrucrG_). Currently, the following `<dataset>`s are available:
- CRUST-Bench - C projects here use Make, not CMake. C2Rust-ification succeeds for 50/100 projects.
- B01_organic (test corpus) - C projects here use CMake. All can be C2Rust-ed successfully!
- B01_synthetic (test corpus) - C projects here use CMake. All can be C2Rust-ed successfully!
