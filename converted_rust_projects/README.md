Each zip file in this folder is named as `c2rust_<dataset>.zip`, and contains Rust projects. These were obtained via running C2Rust in bulk on the `<dataset>` of C projects.

Unzipping each zip file will lead to one folder for each successfully converted Rust project from `<dataset>`, and a `results.csv` file with success / failure status of each project.
