As discussed in Tractor Team meeting on Jan 7th 2027, the contents of this folder are not pushed to Git.

The contents can be generated by executing the `run_on_<dataset>()` functions in `scripts/run_c2rust_and_get_datasets.py`. Each such function execution produces a subfolder at `./c2rust_<dataset>/` containing (unsafe) Rust projects obtained via running C2Rust in bulk on an existing `<dataset>` of C projects. The subfolder will also contain a `results.csv` file with success / failure status of each project.

If you don't want to run the script and instead just get the subfolders containing Rust projects, they are each zipped up and uploaded to Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1jIB0TyJOsmL9nl0rALTEj9qugdrucrG_). Currently, the following `<dataset>`s are available:
- CRUST-Bench
- B01_organic (test corpus)
- B01_synthetic (test corpus)
